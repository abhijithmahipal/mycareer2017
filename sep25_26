Had gone to donate blood to hospital for an emergency requirement, tday. Later in the evening started the coding of project, after completing 4 chapters in eloquentjs text. The confusions were solved with the help of my collegues.
Today resumed coding and now it works for single functionality multiplication. The eval function is working now. Have to add further functions tomorrow, then start second part of project.
