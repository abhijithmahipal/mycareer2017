On 8th i couldnt do anything as i travelled from tvm to thrissur.
On 9th i completed the remaining problems in chapter 2 and thus completed.
I found it very interesting to solve them. 
On 10th i moved to chapter 3. Wasted time till noon due to a sistake in program, which i should have avoided. Then i solved couple of problems in os module and paused task 2 for 2 days. I have a final face2face interview at valorem office on thursday, so spent some time in os concepts, refered notes on them and them tried some C puzzles.
